  description: >-
    RESTful API for managing domains, DNS records, and related services at
    name.com.  Access via HTTPS at api.name.com (production) or api.dev.name.com
    (testing).  Supports standard authentication, rate-limited to 20
    requests/second.

  - BasicAuth: []
tags:
  - name: Hello
    description: >-
      Use the Hello endpoint to verify that your API connection and credentials
      are working properly. This simple call returns a success message (along
      with server time and version info) to confirm the API is reachable and
      authenticated.
  - name: Account Info
    description: >-
      Use Account Info endpoints to retrieve basic information about your
      name.com account. For example, you can check your account’s current credit
      balance and other account details using these endpoints.
  - name: Accounts
    description: >-
      Use Accounts endpoints (available upon request) to manage sub-accounts
      under your main account. For example, resellers can programmatically
      create new customer accounts with their own login credentials and
      permissions.
  - name: Domains
    description: >-
      Use Domains endpoints to search for domain availability, register new
      domains, and manage existing domains.
  - name: Contact Verification
    description: >-
      Use Contact Verification endpoints to query a reseller’s unverified
      domains/emails and to programmatically mark an end user’s email as
      verified if the reseller has already completed the verification process.
      These endpoints help resellers meet ICANN requirements by ensuring end
      users confirm they can receive email at their listed address.
  - name: DNS
    description: >-
      Use DNS endpoints to manage DNS records for your domains. You can list all
      existing DNS records for a domain and create, update, or delete records as
      needed.
  - name: DNSSECs
    description: >-
      Use DNSSEC endpoints to configure DNS Security Extensions for your
      domains. These endpoints allow you to add, retrieve, or remove DNSSEC
      records.
  - name: Email Forwardings
    description: >-
      Use Email Forwardings endpoints to set up and manage email forwarding
      addresses on your domains.
  - name: URL Forwardings
    description: >-
      Use URL Forwardings endpoints to control URL redirection settings for your
      domains.
  - name: Vanity Nameservers
    description: >-
      Use Vanity Nameservers endpoints to configure custom nameserver hostnames
      (glue records) for your domains.
  - name: Transfers
    description: >-
      Use Transfers endpoints to move domains into your name.com account. Start
      by creating a transfer request for inbound transfers from **external**
      registrars, then monitor and manage the status of pending transfers. Use
      **internal transfer in** to pull a domain from another name.com account
      into your reseller account (enterprise allowlist; requires auth code from
      the losing account’s dashboard). You can cancel an incoming transfer if
      needed, or cancel an outbound transfer (domain leaving name.com) via the
      external transfer-out cancel endpoint. Use the **transfer eligibility**
      endpoint to check whether a domain is currently at name.com before
      initiating a transfer, so you can route to the correct flow (external vs
      internal transfer).
  - name: Orders
    description: Use Orders endpoints to review and track purchases made via the API.
  - name: Refunds
    description: >
      Use the Refunds endpoint to delete eligible domains and advanced security
      products during the Add Grace Period (AGP) and automatically issue refunds
      for the associated order items. You can use the List Orders endpoint to
      retrieve order IDs, then pass those IDs into the Refunds endpoint to
      process eligible deletions and refunds.   This endpoint enforces AGP
      delete limits and supports only domain registrations and advanced security
      add-ons. Refunds are issued  to the original payment method on file. If
      the original payment method is unavailable, the refund will be credited to
      the account balance.
  - name: Webhook Notifications
    description: >
      Use Webhook Notification endpoints to subscribe to real-time notifications
      for account and domain events. This keeps your application updated on
      important changes without polling the API.

      Outbound webhook POSTs include an `X-NAMECOM-SIGNATURE` header. HMAC uses
      one API v4 token per account, chosen deterministically when multiple
      tokens exist (see HMAC Signature Verification in the developer docs). The
      signing input format is unchanged.
  - name: Domain Info
    description: >-
      Use Domain Info endpoints to retrieve information about TLD-specific
      requirements and registration rules. These endpoints help you understand
      what fields, documents, or constraints are needed to successfully register
      domains across different TLDs.
  - name: TLD Pricing
    description: >-
      Use TLD Pricing endpoints to retrieve general pricing information for your
      account.
